Below are the points which I have learned today

1. String Interpolation
2. Property Binding
3. Event Binding
4. Two-Way Data Binding
5. Did small assignment to better understand all above points.
    Assignment 1 task given below:-
    1. Add a input field which updates the porperty "username" via Two-Way binding
    2. Output the username property via String interpolation (in a paragraph below input)
    3. Add a button which may only be clicked if the username is NOT an empty string
    4. Upon clicking the button, the username should be reset to in EMPTY string

Learned about Build-in DIRECTIVES of angular like *ngIf, *ngFor, ngStyle, ngClass
And, also did a small assignement based on this

Assignment 2 task given below:-
    1. Add A button which says 'Display Details'
    2. Add a paragraph with any content of your choice (e.g. 'Secret password = tuna')
    3. Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with the button created in the first step
    4. Log all button clicks in an array and output that array below the secret paragraph (may be log a timestamp or increment no)
    5. Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color  (via ngClass) without using index
    6. Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color  (via ngClass) with using index
